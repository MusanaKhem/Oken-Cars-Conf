---------------------------------------------------------------|


The following variables are available to shell and batch build steps:

BRANCH_NAME
1) For a multibranch project, this will be set to the name of the branch being built, for example in case you wish to deploy to production from master but not from feature branches; if corresponding to some kind of change request, the name is generally arbitrary (refer to CHANGE_ID and CHANGE_TARGET).

BRANCH_IS_PRIMARY
2) For a multibranch project, if the SCM source reports that the branch being built is a primary branch, this will be set to "true"; else unset. Some SCM sources may report more than one branch as a primary branch while others may not supply this information.

CHANGE_ID
3) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the change ID, such as a pull request number, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_URL
4) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the change URL, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_TITLE
5) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the title of the change, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_AUTHOR
6) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the username of the author of the proposed change, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_AUTHOR_DISPLAY_NAME
7) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the human name of the author, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_AUTHOR_EMAIL
8) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the email address of the author, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_TARGET
9) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the target or base branch to which the change could be merged, if supported; else unset.

CHANGE_BRANCH
10) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the name of the actual head on the source control system which may or may not be different from BRANCH_NAME. For example in GitHub or Bitbucket this would have the name of the origin branch whereas BRANCH_NAME would be something like PR-24.

CHANGE_FORK
11) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the name of the forked repo if the change originates from one; else unset.

TAG_NAME
12) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of tag, this will be set to the name of the tag being built, if supported; else unset.

TAG_TIMESTAMP
13) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of tag, this will be set to a timestamp of the tag in milliseconds since Unix epoch, if supported; else unset.

TAG_UNIXTIME
14) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of tag, this will be set to a timestamp of the tag in seconds since Unix epoch, if supported; else unset.

TAG_DATE
15) For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of tag, this will be set to a timestamp in the format as defined by java.util.Date#toString() (e.g., Wed Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 2020), if supported; else unset.

JOB_DISPLAY_URL
16) URL that will redirect to a Job in a preferred user interface

RUN_DISPLAY_URL
17) URL that will redirect to a Build in a preferred user interface

RUN_ARTIFACTS_DISPLAY_URL
18) URL that will redirect to Artifacts of a Build in a preferred user interface

RUN_CHANGES_DISPLAY_URL
19) URL that will redirect to Changelog of a Build in a preferred user interface

RUN_TESTS_DISPLAY_URL
20) URL that will redirect to Test Results of a Build in a preferred user interface

CI
21) Statically set to the string "true" to indicate a "continuous integration" execution environment.

BUILD_NUMBER
22) The current build number, such as "153".

BUILD_ID
23) The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created in 1.597+, but a YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss timestamp for older builds.

BUILD_DISPLAY_NAME
24) The display name of the current build, which is something like "#153" by default.

JOB_NAME
25) Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".

JOB_BASE_NAME
26) Short Name of the project of this build stripping off folder paths, such as "foo" for "bar/foo".

BUILD_TAG
27) String of "jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}". All forward slashes ("/") in the JOB_NAME are replaced with dashes ("-"). Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.

EXECUTOR_NUMBER
28) The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) thatâ€™s carrying out this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.

NODE_NAME

NODE_LABELS
30) Whitespace-separated list of labels that the node is assigned.

WORKSPACE
31) The absolute path of the directory assigned to the build as a workspace.

WORKSPACE_TMP
32) A temporary directory near the workspace that will not be browsable and will not interfere with SCM checkouts. May not initially exist, so be sure to create the directory as needed (e.g., mkdir -p on Linux). Not defined when the regular workspace is a drive root.

JENKINS_HOME
33) The absolute path of the directory assigned on the controller file system for Jenkins to store data.

JENKINS_URL
34) Full URL of Jenkins, like http://server:port/jenkins/ (note: only available if Jenkins URL set in system configuration).

BUILD_URL
35) Full URL of this build, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/15/ (Jenkins URL must be set).

JOB_URL
36) Full URL of this job, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/ (Jenkins URL must be set).

GIT_COMMIT
37) The commit hash being checked out.

GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT
38) The hash of the commit last built on this branch, if any.

GIT_PREVIOUS_SUCCESSFUL_COMMIT
39) The hash of the commit last successfully built on this branch, if any.

GIT_BRANCH
40) The remote branch name, if any.

GIT_LOCAL_BRANCH
41) The local branch name being checked out, if applicable.

GIT_CHECKOUT_DIR
42) The directory that the repository will be checked out to. This contains the value set in Checkout to a sub-directory, if used.

GIT_URL
43) The remote URL. If there are multiple, will be GIT_URL_1, GIT_URL_2, etc.

GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
44) The configured Git committer name, if any, that will be used for FUTURE commits from the current workspace. It is read from the Global Config user.name Value field of the Jenkins Configure System page.

GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
45) The configured Git author name, if any, that will be used for FUTURE commits from the current workspace. It is read from the Global Config user.name Value field of the Jenkins Configure System page.

GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
46) The configured Git committer email, if any, that will be used for FUTURE commits from the current workspace. It is read from the Global Config user.email Value field of the Jenkins Configure System page.

GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
